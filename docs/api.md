Title: API Documentation


An API documentation can be generated directly from source code with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl).
If Doxygen is installed on your system, you may simply call `doxygen` in the repository's root directory.
The generated HTML documentation can then be found at *doxygen/html/index.html*.

We also maintain an [online copy](https://www.vanetza.org/doxygen/index.html) which is updated every now and then.
Please generate the API documenation yourself if you need it to match a particular or more recent version of Vanetza.
